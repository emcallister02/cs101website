<p> With most of the world’s population still in lockdown there are lots of different people and businesses that are moving to video conferencing apps to stay in contact<a href="bibliography.html#Cite28">[28]</a>. Many businesses are using these apps to allow their employees to work from home <a href="bibliography.html#Cite29">[29]</a>. <br><br>
A record-breaking number of downloads were made back in March with 62 million people downloading video conferencing apps due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of all the video conferencing apps the one which was downloaded the most was zoom which is still in high demand throughout the United Kingdom, United States and Europe <a href="bibliography.html#Cite29">[29]</a>. Zoom have been remarkably successful throughout the pandemic since working from home is mandatory for many sections of the working population. Downloads of another app, house party, were 2360 times more between March 16th – 21st than the weekly average was last year<a href="bibliography.html#Cite30">[30]</a>. Zoom announced back in April that it had reached over 300 million users daily, which was 100 million more than they had at the start of that month (an increase of 50%). What is even more ridiculous is the fact that they had 10 million users in December the year before<a href="bibliography.html#Cite31">[31]</a>. Zoom keeps a statistic called “annualised meeting minutes” which went up 20 times from 100 billion to 2 trillion<a href="bibliography.html#Cite30">[30]</a>. Daily downloads of the app in April were 30x more than they were since 2018 and it has stayed in the top 3 apps in the apple app store since March 18th 2020<a href="bibliography.html#Cite32">[32]</a>.<br><br>
Many different things have moved online now including school classrooms, church services and even things such as blind dates<a href="bibliography.html#Cite33">[33]</a>. The British lawmakers even broke their 700-year tradition of meeting in the houses of parliament by meeting on zoom<a href="bibliography.html#Cite31">[31]</a>.<br><br>
The app is intended to be used by big businesses and offers a corporate licence for £15.99 per month per host. The company’s revenue increased by 85% during the pandemic<a href="bibliography.html#Cite33">[33]</a>. The company’s stock rose 67% since the start of the lockdown attracting many investors to the company<a href="bibliography.html#Cite32">[32]</a>. Zoom’s sales are expected to be at around $1.8 billion, the equivalent to £1.4 billion. Which is around double what they expected in March. All of this despite the fact that zoom was not even intended for that many people to use it<a href="bibliography.html#Cite34">[34]</a>.<br><br>
When lockdown started, Zoom decided to ease the limits on the free version in china and for many schools around the world. This hugely increased its popularity. This influx in users has put pressure on the firm however, forcing it to invest even though most of its users are not paying customers<a href="bibliography.html#Cite34">[34]</a>. Zoom has had to compete with many companies such as Microsoft, Google and Cisco to get to where they are, and they are still uncertain of what will happen to them after the COVID-19 pandemic. Their hope is that the memories people have had on zoom will make them want to stay and maybe even become paying members<a href="bibliography.html#Cite32">[32]</a>.<br><br>
