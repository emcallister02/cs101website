<p>I will be researching how COVID-19 has forced change and action from businesses when considering cyber-security as well as the new attacks created by scammers looking to profit off of COVID-19. Online scams had arisen before the pandemic had even really hit the country as by January 2020 multiple emails went out to people, posing as the government and other organisations as phising scams using threat actors using programs like TrickBot, Ryuk and Dridex <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.These scammers are profiting off of the fear of the pandemic as early as possible. These scams could lead to massive damage for many small businesses trying to find certainty and thinking these phising emails were just that. These phising emails could also damage a business’s reputation if a victim of the scam thinks they are still directly involved which is likely to happen when the victim is elderly and confused of what has happened or even in huge organisations a employee could be scammed into believing the malware was given to them by the business themselves causing more damage for the business on the whole.Nine out of 10 coronavirus domains are scams.<a href="#ref5">[5]</a> Another scam delivered to people’s inboxes was a fake covid-19 virus map that would instead install trojans onto victims computers stealing very sensitive data <a href="#ref2"> [2] </a> while also providing completely fabricated information about the deadly virus. Unfortunately the economic impact of covid-19 has an unintended effect on cyber security as many businesses view cyber security programs as expendable and will cut them off to save money leaving the business more open to cyber attacks and malware as a whole <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.

  Working form home has also created multiple exploitable roots for hackers and scammers to find their way in. Many of these people working from home are using remote desktops to access their computers at their offices however since so many are now being used there has been a 40% rise in unsecured remote desktops <a href="#ref6">[6]</a> allowing brute force hacks into these desktops allowing hackers to simple collect the companies data. Zoom has been no stranger to cyber security difficulties as it’s reported that there’s over 500,000 zoom accounts being sold on the dark web<a href="#ref7">[7]</a> that could leave the door wide open for abuse as anyone could simply stroll into any company business meeting with the correct credentials. That’s not the only way zoom is being exploited as there has been a 2000% increase<a href="#ref6">[6]</a> in phising files using zoom as a front to gain access to many unknowing machines.

  <p> During my research I came across a American legal case that dealt with another covid cyber-related attack but different from what I have talked about previously. In July 2020 the US department of Justice announced charges that accused two Chinese hackers of taking confidential data from companies surrounding Covid 19 related business.<a href="#ref8">[8]</a> These hackers had apparently been hacking these companies for years but now turned their attention to covid related data as they were working for themselves and China’s ministry of state security. Covid-19 has also been used in political cyber wars as confidential high profile data.
