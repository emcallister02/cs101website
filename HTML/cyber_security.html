<h1>Cyber security during COVID-19</h1>
<div>
<p>I will be researching how COVID-19 has forced change and action from businesses when considering cyber-security as well as the new attacks created by scammers looking to profit off of COVID-19. Online scams had arisen before the pandemic had even really hit the country as by January 2020 multiple emails went out to people, posing as the government and other organisations as phising scams using threat actors using programs like TrickBot, Ryuk and Dridex <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.These scammers are profiting off of the fear of the pandemic as early as possible. These scams could lead to massive damage for many small businesses trying to find certainty and thinking these phising emails were just that. These phising emails could also damage a business’s reputation if a victim of the scam thinks they are still directly involved which is likely to happen when the victim is elderly and confused of what has happened or even in huge organisations a employee could be scammed into believing the malware was given to them by the business themselves causing more damage for the business on the whole. Another scam delivered to people’s inboxes was a fake covid-19 virus map that would instead install trojans onto victims computers stealing very sensitive data <a href="#ref2"> [2] </a> while also providing completely fabricated information about the deadly virus. Unfortunately the economic impact of covid-19 has an unintended effect on cyber security as many businesses view cyber security programs as expendable and will cut them off to save money leaving the business more open to cyber attacks and malware as a whole <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
