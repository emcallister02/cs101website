Energy usage overall will have decreased slightly since the start of lockdown but has started to increase again overtime. <a href="#R501">[501]</a>
</p>
<p class="text">
Some businesses may have closed down therefore there will be no need to use their machinery. Offices have generally closed down too, and offices provide work for hundreds of employees. This would mean that each employee will work from home if they can, thus spreading out the energy consumption to each of their homes meaning it will actually increase as they use their own energy supplies instead of sharing it in the offices eg sharing the lighting and computers. Peak time for work bandwidth is now generally later on in the day, energy usage in the morning (ie between 0600-0900) has dropped by approximately 20%. Due to the lack of commuting to work and being able to work from home with flexibility, people are now using the morning to lie in. Lying in will also help improve staff happiness as they will be well rested, this can also improve productivity. <a href="#R502">[502]</a>
</p>
<p class="text">
Not as many people are commuting to work anymore, rail travel decreased to around 5% of normal usage in March and April due to the sharp outbreak of COVID-19 which resulted in cuts to the timetable. This means I believe that rail companies such as Scotrail can save energy by not running as many trains when there is no demand for it in terms of passenger loadings. <a href="#R503">[503]</a>
