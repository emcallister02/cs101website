When the initial lockdown period began on 16th March 2020, businesses had to react quickly in adapting in order to continue to function under new guidelines. The lockdown guidelines included the closure of all non essential businesses, all essential businesses having to implement distancing measures keeping employees and customers two metres apart at all times; and working from home was required for all those employees for whom that was possible [1]. This page will focus mainly on the first two of these guidelines as the third will be highlighted in the “Working from home” page.
</p>

<p>
The closure of non essential businesses created great uncertainty for many businesses in March as their income stopped immediately. In terms of their employees, the Government Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme [2] allowed employers to furlough those employees for whom there was no work to be done. Had this not been introduced, these businesses with no income would have no alternative but to make the employees redundant. Whilst these non operating businesses still had to deal with other costs such as property rent, this scheme managed to keep many medium sized businesses afloat during this period. The rules of the scheme in terms of the % contribution paid by the Government changed over time starting at 80% and decreasing in incriments of 10.
</p>

<p>
However this furlough scheme also had some major flaws with reports of billions of pounds being fraudulently claimed.Some businesses allegedly were claiming that they had furloughed their staff but in reality they were making these employees work and avoiding their cost by claiming it from the Government [3].

Another problem associated with having a lack of staff on site is security. First off businesses had to make sure security staff were abiding by guidelines and may have had to alter how the system operated eg. not having two security officers in the same room or having a screen to protect any front gate security. In normal circumstances employees would also be able to assist by alerting security staff to any emergencies such as the start of a fire. However with no one on site the responsibilities of the security team are increased. Companies in these conditions may have to check and update their insurance policies. Security staff would also be advised to check their full site, top to bottom, including looking for faulty locks, blind spots in CCTV and carrying out alarm checks [4].

<p>
In relation to essential businesses which continued operation, they had to make sure that all staff and customers were two metres apart at all times. Ways in which businesses implemented this included: [5]
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use of floor markings</li>

    <li>Posters to remind people to keep their distance</li>

    <li>Reducing the amount of time employees spend in communal areas such as corridors and canteens</li>

    <li>Splitting teams into different working patterns in order to reduce the number of people on site at a time </li>
</ul>

<p>
Typically in a 24 hour production cycle the shift teams either work 8 or 12 hour shifts. During the lockdown period some of those businesses that were operating had to adapt their schedules to remove the risk of shift overlaps. Businesses also would run more night shifts to have the least number of people on site at any time. [6]
